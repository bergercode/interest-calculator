# interest-calculator

A simple interest calculator made with JavaFX.

This was a personal challenge to see if I could build a basic interest calculator in ~1 hour.

Installation
----------------
Firstly, you must have [Java](https://www.java.com) installed. The calculator can be run either in command line, or in Intellij/Eclipse.

This will eventually be updated to include a GUI
